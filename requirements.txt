# Cherry 101 - Requirements

## Dependencies for CherryScript Runtime & Cherry 101

This `requirements.txt` file contains all Python dependencies required to run Cherry 101—the world's first CherryScript program—and the CherryScript language runtime.

### **Core Language Runtime**
These packages support the CherryScript interpreter and its execution environment:
- Standard Python libraries for parsing and runtime execution
- Mock adapters for database, ML, and API operations (included in package)
- CLI interface for running `.cherry` script files

### **Development & Testing**
- Python 3.8+ for language features and type hints
- Mock objects for demonstration without external services
- JSON handling for evaluation reports

### **Future Production Dependencies**
For a production deployment (not required for the demo), you would add:
- `mysql-connector-python` for real MySQL database connections
- `h2o` package for actual H2O AutoML integration  
- `fastapi` and `uvicorn` for real model deployment APIs
- `docker-compose` for containerized environments

### **Quick Setup**
```bash
# Install CherryScript runtime and Cherry 101 dependencies
pip install -e .

# Or for minimal setup (mock implementations work without external packages)
# Just ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
```

### **Docker Environment**
The `docker-compose.yml` file sets up:
- MySQL 8.0 for database operations
- H2O 3 for AutoML training
- Custom CherryScript API container for deployment

### **Note on Mock Implementations**
Cherry 101 currently uses mock adapters that simulate:
- Database queries with sample data
- H2O AutoML training with mock models
- FastAPI endpoints with simulated deployment
- Evaluation metrics with calculated statistics

These mocks allow you to experience the complete CherryScript workflow without external service dependencies.
